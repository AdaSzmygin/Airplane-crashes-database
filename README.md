The project presents the creation of a non-relational graph database using Python and the neo4j library. 
First, a dataset showing airplane accidents from 1908 to 2019 was imported into the database. 
Then, the connection between Python and the database was made and the data was imported into df. 
Then, the data was divided into nodes and edges, and a second data set was added, showing the last words spoken. 
In the next step, queries were made, e.g. about the number of deaths on a given route. 
Indexes were also added and a procedure was created.
